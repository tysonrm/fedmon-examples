# federated-monolith

Using module federation (a la Zack Jackson) and clean architecture (a la Uncle Bob), federated monoliths combine the independence and agility of microservices with the integration and deployment simplicity of monoliths. This simple API framework supports CRUD operations for a domain model imported from a remote server with only a very basic contract.

See [federated-monolith-services](https://github.com/tysonrm/federated-monolith-services) for federated modules used by this project.
